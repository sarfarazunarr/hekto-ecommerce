# Day 6 - Final Deployment of Hekto
On Day 6 we made our website live from development mode to production mode where we configured our github repo on vercel and connect it.

I setup all environment variables that are used in my website in vercel and on sanity i configure my current deployed origin in origin access section to avoid `cors-origin` errors.

And Finally web app is live here >> [(https://hekto-ecommerce-web.vercel.app)]
