# Day 5 - Testing and Backend Refinement - Hekto
Today we were tasked to test our website and design test case csv file which is available in current repository.

### Functional Testing
I tested my website and found some issues that were marked in test case like issue in searching.

### Error Handling
I have already added fallback ui or message that will display where there is no data available and loading ui when products are loading.

### Performance Testing
My Website has **90** Performance rate according Lighthouse. It will be more better in next day 6.
Other parts of website is working as expected.

### Cross-Browser and Device Testing
I tested my website on `edge` browser where it worked expectedly. 
I checked my website responsiveness with Chrome's builtin responsiveness feature and with my mobile also, it behaving as expected.

### Security Testing
There is one minimal issue which is not validating inputs. I will make it more secure in ndext day 6.
My All Secure Keys are stored in `.env` file.

### User Acceptance Testing
I browsed my website and it worked expected but found issues that are mentioned above.

All Issues will be resolved in **Day 6**.
Thanks
