# Journey from Day 1 to Day 6

In this hackathon I have done following tasks:
* First we defined our business goal, requirements, market approach, data schemas
* We were moved to Techincal Foundation where we created our System Architectures, create Sanity Schemas that aligns with our requirments.
* We integrated third party APIs in our system and imported that data to our sanity and then we fetch required data from sanity and displayed it on frontend.
* We integrated Sanity APIs on all our components and then displayed product details there we also added cart, search & Filter options.
* We refined our backend to work seamlessly with our frontend where we write test cases to measure weather our product meatch with our requirements.
* Finally, we resolved all issues and then deployed it on vercel where we configured all setting so that our web app can work exactly what we want!

* Thanks to GIAIC & Faculty for providing these amazing hackathons!
